Development Rules
1. NO new features until first paying customer

3. Manual processes are fine initially
4. No frameworks, no databases, no APIs
5. GitHub Pages only (free hosting)

Monetization
- 89/month for weekly reports
- Payment via email/PayPal (manual)
- No automation until 10 customers

For Codex/AI
When generating code:
- Assume user won't do sales/networking
- Build systems that work without human interaction
- One-time setup > ongoing maintenance
- Direct solutions only, no social features
- Revenue > code quality

Current Status
Starting fresh in ob1-scout repo with only:
- run.py (the scraper that works)
- agent.md (this file)

Next step: Get first customer, not write more code.
